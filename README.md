# The Populinator #

Role playing game master with not much time on your hands?

Ever find your intrepid band of players wandering out of your little sandbox? Tired of completely railroading them?

Now you can whip up a new town!

The townspeople are generated using a simple genetic simulation, using exchange of hex codes in lieu of genes. So children resemble their parents!
