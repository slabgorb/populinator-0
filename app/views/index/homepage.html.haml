    %p Ever find your intrepid band of players wandering out of your little sandbox? Tired of completely railroading them?
    %p Now you can whip up a new town!
    %p The townspeople are generated using a simple genetic simulation, using exchange of hex codes in lieu of genes. So children resemble their parents!

    %p Want a new language to name your towns, and make nice consistent-sounding names.
    %p Point the language generator at a nice body of text in a foreign (to you) language, and it will suck it down, and determine letter combination probabilities.
    %p Grab one or two more, in different languages.
    %p Mix them together and create a new glossary based on the languages.
